Will rewrite to add:

-Real background image (When I find a good one)

-Evaluation bar

-Play again feature

-Play against bots

-Play against other player (?)

-Board flip feature (On GamePigeon, each player starts in bottom left)

-GamePigeon square fill effect

-GamePigeonesque colors (Colors right now are too sharp)
